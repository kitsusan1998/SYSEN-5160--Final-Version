# SYSEN-5160--Final-Version
Abstract\
  Today, loans are one of the most popular, reliable and efficient ways for people to borrow money. Applicants submitted their loan application with required personal information to the bank and the financial institutions decided whether to approve or reject the loan application based on the evaluation of the applicantâ€™s information.However, for those credit applicants, there are lacks of useful tools to help them to have a forecasting and implication analysis on their application decisions before they submit their application to the bank. In order to provide assistance to all the potential loan applicants, we implemented machine learning algorithms and sensitivity analysis to develop an APP that could accurately predict the success rate of a loan application and provide suggestions about the possible methods to boost the chance of success.
